# Fibonacci Sequence Calculator (C++)
This is a simple C++ program that calculates the Fibonacci sequence value at a specified position. The program uses recursion to determine the value at the n-th position in the Fibonacci sequence.

Key Features:
Recursive Function: The program uses a recursive function (fib) to calculate the Fibonacci number at a given position.
User Input: The user inputs the position (n) in the Fibonacci sequence, and the program computes and outputs the Fibonacci number at that position.
Output: The Fibonacci value at the specified position is displayed as the result.
Fibonacci Sequence Overview:
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.
